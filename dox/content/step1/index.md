## Hello World

For "Hello World" in each environment, we'll create an empty .NET Core console application.  To view the entire completed source from this step, see [the checkpoint for step 1](https://github.com/danieljsummers/FromObjectsToFunctions/tree/step-1-core2).

All projects were created using `dotnet new -t console -l C#` (or `F#`).
