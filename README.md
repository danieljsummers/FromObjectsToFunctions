## <span style="color:red;">THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED</span>

**New Repository:** https://github.com/bit-badger/o2f

**New Website:** https://objects-to-functions.bitbadger.solutions

The code in this repository targets .Net Core version 1, with `project.json` and using packages that were, at the time, in pre-release status. Additionally, the company behind [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com) shuttered, and while it was transferred to the Linux Foundation and is open source, its development has slowed substantially. There are a few branches where updates to .Net Core 2 and [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net) were targeted, but those are incomplete. Finally, since the original development, [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe) was released as a functional way to do ASP.NET Core development.

The linked repository and site above can be thought of as "version 2" of this effort, although the name has changed slightly. It also contains five repositories:

1. ASP.NET Core MVC / C# (**Uno**) - The C# standard

2. Nancy / C# (**Dos**) - A popular alternative

3. Nancy / F# (**Tres**) - A C#-to-F# translation of **Dos**

4. Giraffe / F# (**Quatro**) - Part translation of **Uno**, part evolving to more idiomatic F#

5. Freya / F# (**Cinco**) - Fully-functional implementation using very few libraries

_(This README update is the final update that will occur in this repository; if you have starred this repository and want to continue to track its development, please star [the new repository](https://github.com/bit-badger/o2f) instead.)_
